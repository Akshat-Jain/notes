We are going to cover <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a> book by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/" target="_blank">Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau</a> and <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/" target="_blank">Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau</a>.

We will read **2-3 chapters a week** and discuss over a Google Group. Your email will be visible to other group members if you post, but otherwise it will not be visible to anyone.

## Sign up

**If you'd like to join the group, please fill this <a href="https://forms.gle/XK3yjmJmdUouv2VB9" target="_blank">Google form</a>. For any questions, you can reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/AkJn99" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.**

Please spread the word to anyone who might be interested! :)

Also, you don't need to be an expert to join along. We are all in it to learn together as a community!

## Medium of discussion

All discussions will be done over text emails. We don't plan on having any Zoom or Google Meet calls. This allows people to read at their own pace asynchronously, and still be able to participate in the discussion.

## How to get the book

The PDF version of the book is available for free <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/#book-chapters" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also see other options <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Weekly Chapter Leaders

We will have one person lead the discussion each week. They will send out an email by Saturday/Sunday of that respective week recapping the chapters and sharing their thoughts. It doesn't have to be exhaustive, could even be a couple of paragraphs - the main intent is to get the discussion going and give others a starting point to chime in.

I'd love to see people interested in volunteering to lead a chapter. But if there aren't any leaders for a week, I'll take up this responsibility and get the discussion going.

To the leaders: You don't have to worry about being an expert, or about what to say. It's a community discussion, and we're all in it to learn from each other! :)

## Discussion Schedule

Note: Each week ranges between 20-40 pages, averaging at 31 pages per week.
