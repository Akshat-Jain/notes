I'm thinking of the following hierarchy:
- Root: Me

- Career journey
- College life
- Initiatives: Started by me and the ones I was involved in
- Books
- Hobbies/Interests
- Songs
- Movies
- Sports
- Subdomains
- Random thoughts
- Social links

Initiatives:
1. Started by me (reading group, community experiment, Blog writing)
2. I was a part of (reading group by Phil, Abhinav's session on 1BRC)


Other dendron related todos:
1. Figure out how kevinlin.com has home.md as the entry page and where is root.md page
2. Create template for books
3. Ordering for the headers in the sidebar
