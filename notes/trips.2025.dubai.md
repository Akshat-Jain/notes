My trip was from 16th December to 27th December.

It was my first time flying with Emirates. It was a CRAZY GOOD experience!!!
- Leg space was much better than what I'm used to with Indigo etc.
- Complimentary meal was crazy good.
- In-flight entertainment system was great, with shows like FRIENDS etc as well as flight info to follow along and keep you occupied.

I reached Dubai airport at 17th December 00:00 AM (Dubai time, also referred to as GST).

### Visa on Arrival

Since I have a B1/B2 US Visa, I had decided to opt in for Visa on Arrival.
1. Went to Marhaba counter, paid 240 AED there. Barely took 2 minutes.
2. Took me 5 minutes to search for immigration (I mistakenly went in the smart gates initially, that's on me)
3. Took 2 minutes in the immigration itself.

### Reaching my friend's place

I had plans to stay with my friend at his place for the entire duration of the trip.
1. I booked an Uber Green from the airport to JLT Cluster L. It cost 130 AED but I was just too excited at the prospect of sitting in a Tesla so eh worth it.
2. A Tesla Model Y arrived. It was my first time looking at a Tesla in-person, let alone sitting in it.
3. Also caught a glimpse of Burj Khalifa on the way to my friend's place.

### Day 1 (17th December, 2025)

Went to DMCC metro station. It was 10-15 minutes walk from my friend's place. Got a silver tier Nol card. It cost 25 AED, but gives 19 AED as balance.

Went to Mall of the Emirates:
1. Cost 3 AED (crazy cheap!) to go from DMCC metro station to Mall of the Emirates metro station.
2. Booked ticket for Avatar movie for 18th December 12 PM in VOX Cinemas Mall of the Emirates for IMAX 3D, cost me 109 AED.

Went to Dubai Mall:
1. Cost 5 AED to go from Mall of the Emirates metro station to Dubai Mall metro station, but I had mistakenly not checked in at Mall of the Emirates so I had to pay 10.5 AED as the exit charge.
2. Took the bus from Dubai Mall metro station to Dubai Mall (for free using the exit card).
3. Reached Dubai Mall, went to 6th floor, crossed the bridge, came down 3 floors to Lower Ground floor, and went to see Dubai Fountain at the 1 PM slot. I knew Dubai Mall is big but I was still not prepared for how insanely big and time-consuming and tiring it was, sighs only.

Went to Dubai fountain:
1. Somehow rushed through the infinite-length Dubai Mall to make it in time for the 1 PM fountain show.
2. The 1 PM fountain show was AMAZING! I was just mesmerised at the amazing show and the song they were playing. The song was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5M7fPSWz8A
3. Saw 1:30 PM show also while eating at Pizza Hut. 1:30 PM show had a different song, I didn't like it as much as the previous one but anyway. That Pizza Hut seemed to have some exclusive menu for drinks, I tried Pepsi Coffee Boost and that is the best drink I've had in my life so far. Insanely good!

Went to Apple Store at the Dubai Mall:
1. Tried Airpods Pro 3, they were great. Let's see when I buy them.
2. Booked a demo session for Apple Vision Pro, luckily got a timeslot for just a few minutes later. Did the session, Apple Vision Pro is CRAZY GOOD. A piece of technology has blown my mind away after a long long long period of time.

Went to inquire Dubai Ice Rink in Dubai Mall, but decided not to do it as it had decent chances of causing injuries.

Walked and walked and walked to find Emirates simulator in the Dubai Mall, finally found it but it had waiting for 1.5 hours so I gave up and decided to come home.

Took a taxi from Dubai Mall to my friend's place. Meter started at 5 AED. Car was Exeed 2025 (some Chinese EV hybrid car). It cost 70.5 AED (and Uber was showing 110-140 AED).

Taxis seem to have coloured roofs, each colour representing a company. There are 5 companies (that RTA overlooks or something), that is, 5 colours at the moment.

Came home, then went to Dubai Marina in a Lexus with my friend for casual strolling and dinner.

### Day 2 (18th December, 2025)

Took ab Uber Lux to DMCC metro station for 44 AED, an Audi came. I topped up my Nol card with 30 AED.

Went to Mall of the Emirates to watch the Avatar movie. Movie itself was meh, but the IMAX experience was crazy good.

Then went to do Ski Dubai in the same mall.
1. Got 335 AED ticket at a 20% discount thanks to the Emirates boarding pass.
2. I got day access to snow park, and 6:30 PM session for skiing discovery lesson for which I had to report at 6 PM to the Ski School thing to get skiing clothes/gear etc.
3. I got gloves for 35 AED, lanyard for 10 AED - will get to keep them later. Only need to change shoes later for the skiing lesson.
4. Snow park was good. It was my first time seeing snow in my life. It's a bizarre/great experience going from desert heat to literal sub-zero temperature zone, that was fun. I did an ice sled ride but that idiotic ride caused my right knee and right elbow to hit against the snow wall during the ride. Was scared for my right knee because of the ACL history. It was bad for a couple of days but luckily it got better post that.
5. Did the Skiing lesson thing after that. Let's just say that I have a profound respect for people who are able to ski. Skiing is difficult af, the skates are just super heavy. (I also got 6 feet skates because of my height, sighs only)
6. Collected 2 photos digitally along with the corresponding leather album for 160 AED each.

There were some weather warnings about rain while I was doing all these indoor activities. Luckily it didn't mess up my travel plans on the subsequent days.

### Day 3 (19th December, 2025)

Went to see Museum of the Future (from DMCC metro station to Emirates Tower station), didn't get tickets as they were sold out till mid January, but got to see the entrance and the lobby area which was pretty cool.

Had my lunch at Capri Italian Grill (https://www.instagram.com/capriitaliangrill), the pizza was dope!

Went to Dubai Frame after that. Really enjoyed Dubai Frame. The ticket was also cheap enough, 50 AED if I remember correctly.
