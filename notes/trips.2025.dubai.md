My trip was from 16th December to 27th December.

It was my first time flying with Emirates. It was a CRAZY GOOD experience!!!
- Leg space was much better than what I'm used to with Indigo etc.
- Complimentary meal was crazy good.
- In-flight entertainment system was great, with shows like FRIENDS etc as well as flight info to follow along and keep you occupied.

I reached Dubai airport at 17th December 00:00 AM (Dubai time, also referred to as GST).

### Visa on Arrival

Since I have a B1/B2 US Visa, I had decided to opt in for Visa on Arrival.
1. Went to Marhaba counter, paid 240 AED there. Barely took 2 minutes.
2. Took me 5 minutes to search for immigration (I mistakenly went in the smart gates initially, that's on me)
3. Took 2 minutes in the immigration itself.

### Reaching my friend's place

I had plans to stay with my friend at his place for the entire duration of the trip.
1. I booked an Uber Green from the airport to JLT Cluster L. It cost 130 AED but I was just too excited at the prospect of sitting in a Tesla so eh worth it.
2. A Tesla Model Y arrived. It was my first time looking at a Tesla in-person, let alone sitting in it.
3. Also caught a glimpse of Burj Khalifa on the way to my friend's place.

### Day 1 (17th December, 2025)

Went to DMCC metro station. It was 10-15 minutes walk from my friend's place. Got a silver tier Nol card. It cost 25 AED, but gives 19 AED as balance.

Went to Mall of the Emirates:
1. Cost 3 AED (crazy cheap!) to go from DMCC metro station to Mall of the Emirates metro station.
2. Booked ticket for Avatar movie for 18th December 12 PM in VOX Cinemas Mall of the Emirates for IMAX 3D, cost me 109 AED.

Went to Dubai Mall:
1. Cost 5 AED to go from Mall of the Emirates metro station to Dubai Mall metro station, but I had mistakenly not checked in at Mall of the Emirates so I had to pay 10.5 AED as the exit charge.
2. Took the bus from Dubai Mall metro station to Dubai Mall (for free using the exit card).
3. Reached Dubai Mall, went to 6th floor, crossed the bridge, came down 3 floors to Lower Ground floor, and went to see Dubai Fountain at the 1 PM slot. I knew Dubai Mall is big but I was still not prepared for how insanely big and time-consuming and tiring it was, sighs only.

Dubai fountain:
1. Chinese song
2. Saw 1:30 PM show also while eating at Pizza Hut

### Day 2 (18th December, 2025)
