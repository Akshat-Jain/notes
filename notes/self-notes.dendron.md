Well, the first pain point is Dendron itself.

1. How to achieve https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/r4RrLx4xTM2Sc0yOouLkb/? Use `has_collection: true` in the note's properties. Read more at https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/e4ea4fe3-0350-492e-863a-687d9fc15993/.

2. Don't upgrade Dendron without checking latest GitHub issues, you've suffered enough in the past because of it: https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/3981#issuecomment-2143783423
