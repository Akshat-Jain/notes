English lyrics: Oh, won't you tell me, please just tell me, explain how this should work

oshieru - verb, "to teach" / "to tell" / "to explain"
te-form – used for making requests, commands, or sequential actions

shikumi - noun, means "mechanism", "structure". Often used to refer to "how something works"

Oh, won't you tell me, please just tell me, explain how this should work
Well now who could it be that lives inside of me?
I'm broken, lying helpless, shattered, surrounded by the world
And yet, you're smiling bright, completely blind to life

My ruptured lungs, they were left this way
For once, I'm out of breath
The truth I seek never felt so bleak
But I maintain my depth, freeze

I'm breakable, unbreakable, I'm shaking yet unshakable
Until the day that you find me

I'll stand here, existing and feeling, wretched existence
Consuming life-force 'til I grow distant
Don't bother searching for somebody like me
A fading no one
I don't want to hurt you, it's not my nature
A monster born from dusk to dawn can't be your saviour
Remember the me, the way I used to be

As who I still should be

The isolation spreads and tears, those happy days pierce into me
These lonely memories cease to care, they spread throughout my history

I’ll never move, I’ll never lose
I’ll never move, I’ll never lose
I’ll never move, I’ll never lose you
Unraveling the world
At once, I start changing, yet everything’s remaining
These lives I felt would join as one, they fade away before they’ve begun
I’m breakable, unbreakable, I’m shaking yet unshakable
Until these hands contaminate you

I’ll stand here existing and feeling wretched existence
Consuming life-force 'til I grow distant
Don't bother searching for somebody like me
A fading no one
This lonely space held into place by someone crazy
Shall melt away like dawn to day as things get hazy
So please think of me, the way I used to be

As who I really should be

So don’t forget me, you can’t forget me
You won’t forget me, please don’t forget me

With changing inside I’m completely paralyzed
Remaining corrupt as I wish for paradise
Remember the me, the way I used to be

Oh, won’t you tell
Oh, please just tell
Well now who could it be that lives inside of me?
