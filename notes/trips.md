I like traveling (although I probably don't travel as much as I like to travel). The following tweet of mine summarises my feelings very well towards traveling.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everytime I travel, I&#39;m reminded of how much I love traveling.<br><br>Should cling onto that feeling somehow..</p>&mdash; Akshat Jain (@AkJn99) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkJn99/status/1850489349277651443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is an attempt to have an immutable log of my travel records, starting from a trip to Dubai done in December 2025. I don't plan on backfilling any of the earlier trips, partly because I won't even be able to fully recollect all aspects of them.
