We are going to cover <a href="https://postgrespro.com/community/books/internals" target="_blank">PostgreSQL 14 Internals</a> book by Egor Rogov.

We will read **one chapter a week** and discuss over a Google Group. Your email will be public if you post, but otherwise it will not be visible to anyone.

All discussions will be done over text emails. We don't plan on having any Zoom or Google Meet calls. This allows people to read at their own pace asynchronously, and still be able to participate in the discussion.

The PDF version of the book is available for free <a href="https://edu.postgrespro.com/postgresql_internals-14_en.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also order a printed copy from <a href="https://postgrespro.com/community/books/internals" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Sign up

If you'd like to join the group, please fill this Google form (link todo), or reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/AkJn99" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

Please spread the word to anyone who might be interested! :)

Also, you don't need to be an expert to join along. We are all in it to learn together as a community!

## Leaders
Basically, someone will lead discussion each week sending out an email on Saturday recapping the chapter. It can be as short as a paragraph or two just to get discussion going. Anyone else can chime in afterward. If no one volunteers to lead a chapter, I'll get the discussion going each time.

Don't worry about being an expert and don't worry about what to say, I'll go first and will prod you when it's your turn.

todo: revamp the above copied text

## Discussion Schedule

todo: create a table for possible timeline for each week
