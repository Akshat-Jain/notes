### Random

- Japanese people have a habit of abbreviating long phrases. For example, they abbreviate Arigatou Goizaimasu into (A)rigato Go(za)ima(su) == Azasu.

### Vocabulary
- afraid: bibiru
- answer: kotaeru
- disappointing: Zannen
- kowai: scary (similar looking word: "kawaii" means "cute")
- oboete: to remember

### yasashii vs ii

Goal: How to translate "Nice!"

- "Nice!" != yasashii
- "yasashii" is used as an adjective.
- "ii" is used as "nice" as an expression.
- "yo" is used for emphasis. English equivalent is exclamation mark "!".

Hence, "Nice!" == "ii yo".
