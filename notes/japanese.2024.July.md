Random: Japanese people have a habit of abbreviating long phrases. Even Arigatou Goizaimasu seems too long for them. They informally abbreviate it into (A)rigato Go(za)ima(su) == Azasu.

Vocabulary:
1. afraid: bibiru
2. answer: kotaeru
3. disappointing: Zannen
4. kowai: scary (similar looking word: "kawaii" means "cute")
5. oboete: to remember

### yasashii vs ii

Goal: How to translate "Nice!"

- "Nice!" != yasashii
- "yasashii" is used as an adjective.
- "ii" is used as "nice" as an expression.
- "yo" is used for emphasis. English equivalent is exclamation mark "!".

Hence, "Nice!" == "ii yo".
