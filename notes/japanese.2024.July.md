### Random

- Japanese people have a habit of abbreviating long phrases. For example, they abbreviate Arigatou Goizaimasu into (A)rigato Go(za)ima(su) == Azasu.

### Vocabulary
- afraid: bibiru
- answer: kotaeru
- disappointing: Zannen
- kowai: scary (similar looking word: "kawaii" means "cute")
- oboete: to remember

### yasashii vs ii

Goal: How to translate "Nice!"

- "Nice!" != yasashii
- "yasashii" is used as an adjective.
- "ii" is used as "nice" as an expression.
- "yo" is used for emphasis. English equivalent is exclamation mark "!".

Hence, "Nice!" == "ii yo".

### History Time: Rise of Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana

1. Until around 500AD, Japan did not have any writing system whatsoever.
2. All lessons rules were passed down verbally.
3. Because there were no written records, there are many exceptions as rules change during propagation via word of mouth.
4. Upto this point in time, Japanese and Chinese are two completely different languages.
5. Then, Japanese people adopted Kanji from Chinese as their writing system.
6. Kanji is 1 unique symbol for every word. There's around 40k different Kanji symbols. 200-300 years later, Japanese folks realised that they messed uo adopting Kanji.
7. So they invented Hiragana and Katakana.
8. Hiragana and Katakana are exactly same in pronunciation. Katakana is exclusively used for foreign words which did not originate in Japan (like Indians use train, remote, tv in Hindi).
9. Hiragana and Katakana are invented by Japanese but their symbols are taken from Kanji radicals. (Kanji radicals are kanji characters' foundational components or building blocks. Therefore, these elemental parts are essential clues to a kanji's meaning or pronunciation.)
10. At this point, Japanese folks have the chance to abandon Kanji. But instead they ended up using all 3 systems - Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji. Hence today, Japanese system uses 3 writing systems. Verbally, all 3 systems are the same, but purpose is different.
11. The 3 systems:
    1. Kanji: used for vocabulary (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs etc)
    2. Hiragana: to modify verbs, as particles
    3. Katakana: foreign words

### Example sentence 1

```
(コーヒー)　が　 (好)　です 
Coffee    ga  suki desu
```

- First bracket is katakana, 2nd bracket is kanji.
- Japanese writing system does not contain spaces, they distinguish based on hiragana, katakana, and kanji borders.
- So, if they write everything in hiragana, it might get confusing.

### Example sentence 2

"Mother likes flowers"

```
ははははながすき --- Pure Hiragana == haha ha hana ga suki (if we add spaces)
母は花がすき --- Hiragana + Kanji
```

### Character sets

- All 3 systems are same verbally for Japanese people.
- Both have 46 characters, just written differently.
- Adding `"` and `⁰` to it almost doubles the character set, making it roughly 100 unique sounds in Japanese.
- In comparison, English has 21 consonants and 5 vowels, making it 21x5 == 105 basic sounds. Then we get more sounds by combining consonants with consonants, like "ph", "th", etc. This is much higher than the number of sounds in Japanese.
- Problem with having less number of sounds in Japanese: Everything sounds similar 🥲.
